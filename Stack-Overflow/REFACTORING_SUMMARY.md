# Refactoring Summary: Post Base Class & Simplified Voting

## Overview

The Stack Overflow system has been refactored to follow better object-oriented design principles:

1. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: `Question` and `Answer` now extend an abstract `Post` class
2. **Simplified Voting**: Replaced complex Vote object tracking with simple enum-based voting using `AtomicInteger`

---

## Key Changes

### 1. New Abstract `Post` Class

Created a base class that encapsulates common functionality for both Questions and Answers:

```java
public abstract class Post implements Votable, Commentable {
    protected final String id;
    protected final User author;
    protected String content;
    protected final LocalDateTime createdAt;
    protected LocalDateTime updatedAt;
    
    // Simplified voting - just track vote types per user
    protected final Map<String, VoteType> userVotes; // userId -> VoteType
    protected final AtomicInteger upvotes;
    protected final AtomicInteger downvotes;
    
    // Comments
    protected final List<Comment> comments;
    
    // Common methods for voting and commenting
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Common code is in one place
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Voting and commenting logic centralized
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to voting affect both Question and Answer automatically
- ✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add new post types (e.g., Article, Blog)

### 2. Simplified Voting System

**Before (Complex):**
```java
private final Map<String, Vote> votes; // userId -> Vote object
private final AtomicInteger voteCount;

public Vote addVote(Vote vote) {
    Vote existingVote = votes.get(vote.getUser().getUserId());
    if (existingVote != null) {
        int oldValue = existingVote.getVoteType().getValue();
        int newValue = vote.getVoteType().getValue();
        if (oldValue != newValue) {
            existingVote.changeVote(vote.getVoteType());
            voteCount.addAndGet(newValue - oldValue);
        }
        return existingVote;
    }
    // ... more complex logic
}
```

**After (Simple):**
```java
protected final Map<String, VoteType> userVotes; // userId -> VoteType enum
protected final AtomicInteger upvotes;
protected final AtomicInteger downvotes;

public Vote addVote(Vote vote) {
    String userId = vote.getUser().getUserId();
    VoteType newVoteType = vote.getVoteType();
    VoteType existingVoteType = userVotes.get(userId);
    
    if (existingVoteType != null) {
        // Remove old vote count
        if (existingVoteType == VoteType.UPVOTE) {
            upvotes.decrementAndGet();
        } else {
            downvotes.decrementAndGet();
        }
    }
    
    // Add new vote count
    userVotes.put(userId, newVoteType);
    if (newVoteType == VoteType.UPVOTE) {
        upvotes.incrementAndGet();
    } else {
        downvotes.incrementAndGet();
    }
    
    return vote;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Simpler Logic**: Direct enum tracking instead of Vote object manipulation
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Separate upvote/downvote counters for O(1) access
- ✅ **Clearer Intent**: `upvotes` and `downvotes` are self-documenting
- ✅ **Thread-Safe**: Using `AtomicInteger` for concurrent access
- ✅ **Less Memory**: Store enum instead of full Vote object

### 3. Refactored Question Class

**Before:**
```java
public class Question implements Votable, Commentable {
    // Lots of duplicated code with Answer
    private final String questionId;
    private final User author;
    private String content;
    private final LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
    private final AtomicInteger voteCount;
    private final Map<String, Vote> votes;
    private final List<Comment> comments;
    // ... voting logic
    // ... commenting logic
}
```

**After:**
```java
public class Question extends Post {
    // Only Question-specific fields
    private String title;
    private QuestionStatus status;
    private final AtomicInteger viewCount;
    private final Set<Tag> tags;
    private final List<Answer> answers;
    
    // Inherits all voting and commenting from Post
}
```

**Reduction:** ~100 lines of code removed (voting/commenting logic moved to Post)

### 4. Refactored Answer Class

**Before:**
```java
public class Answer implements Votable, Commentable {
    // Lots of duplicated code with Question
    private final String answerId;
    private final User author;
    private String content;
    private final LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
    private final AtomicInteger voteCount;
    private final Map<String, Vote> votes;
    private final List<Comment> comments;
    // ... voting logic
    // ... commenting logic
}
```

**After:**
```java
public class Answer extends Post {
    // Only Answer-specific fields
    private final Question question;
    private boolean isAccepted;
    
    // Inherits all voting and commenting from Post
}
```

**Reduction:** ~100 lines of code removed (voting/commenting logic moved to Post)

---

## Design Patterns & Principles

### Enhanced Design Patterns

#### 1. **Template Method Pattern** (New)
The `Post` class defines the template for voting and commenting, while subclasses provide specific behavior.

```java
public abstract class Post {
    // Template method
    public Vote addVote(Vote vote) {
        // Common voting logic for all posts
    }
}

public class Question extends Post {
    // Specific question behavior
}

public class Answer extends Post {
    // Specific answer behavior
}
```

### SOLID Principles Strengthened

#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ✅
- `Post`: Manages voting and commenting
- `Question`: Manages question-specific features (title, tags, status, answers)
- `Answer`: Manages answer-specific features (acceptance)

#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** ✅
- Easy to extend with new post types without modifying existing code
- Example: Create `Article extends Post` for blog articles

#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** ✅
- Any `Post` can be substituted for another `Post`
- Both `Question` and `Answer` are valid `Post` objects

#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** ✅
- `Votable` and `Commentable` interfaces remain focused
- `Post` implements both interfaces

#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** ✅
- Code depends on `Post`, `Votable`, `Commentable` abstractions
- Not on concrete `Question` or `Answer` classes

## Voting System Details

### Vote Tracking

**Storage:**
```java
Map<String, VoteType> userVotes;  // userId -> UPVOTE or DOWNVOTE
AtomicInteger upvotes;             // Count of upvotes
AtomicInteger downvotes;           // Count of downvotes
```

**Methods:**
```java
getVoteCount()     → upvotes - downvotes
getUpvotes()       → upvotes
getDownvotes()     → downvotes
getUserVote(userId) → VoteType (UPVOTE/DOWNVOTE/null)
```

### Vote Changes

When a user votes:
1. Check if user has already voted
2. If yes, remove old vote count
3. Add new vote count
4. Update the map with new vote type

Example:
```
Initial: User hasn't voted
- upvotes: 5, downvotes: 2

User upvotes:
- upvotes: 6, downvotes: 2
- userVotes[userId] = UPVOTE

User changes to downvote:
- upvotes: 5, downvotes: 3
- userVotes[userId] = DOWNVOTE
```

### Thread Safety

- ✅ `AtomicInteger` for upvotes/downvotes (atomic operations)
- ✅ `ConcurrentHashMap` for userVotes (thread-safe map)
- ✅ No race conditions when multiple users vote simultaneously

## Code Comparison

### Lines of Code Reduction

| Class      | Before | After | Reduction |
|------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Question   | ~190   | ~95   | -50%      |
| Answer     | ~153   | ~56   | -63%      |
| **Total**  | ~343   | ~151  | **-56%**  |

**New Code:**
- Post class: ~145 lines (shared by both)

**Net Result:** More maintainable, less duplication, clearer structure

---

## Migration Path

### For Future Post Types

Adding a new post type is now trivial:

```java
public class Article extends Post {
    private String title;
    private String category;
    private Set<Tag> tags;
    
    public Article(String id, User author, String content, 
                   String title, String category) {
        super(id, author, content);
        this.title = title;
        this.category = category;
        this.tags = new HashSet<>();
    }
    
    // Automatically gets voting and commenting from Post!
}
```

### Polymorphic Operations

```java
// Can treat all posts uniformly
public void displayVoteStats(Post post) {
    System.out.println("Upvotes: " + post.getUpvotes());
    System.out.println("Downvotes: " + post.getDownvotes());
    System.out.println("Total: " + post.getVoteCount());
}

// Works with Questions and Answers
displayVoteStats(question);
displayVoteStats(answer);
```

---

## Testing Benefits

### Easier to Test

**Before:** Had to test voting logic in both Question and Answer
**After:** Test voting logic once in Post, verify in subclasses

```java
@Test
public void testPostVoting() {
    // Test on any Post implementation
    Post post = new TestPost();
    
    post.addVote(new Vote("V1", user1, VoteType.UPVOTE));
    assertEquals(1, post.getVoteCount());
    assertEquals(1, post.getUpvotes());
    
    post.addVote(new Vote("V2", user1, VoteType.DOWNVOTE));
    assertEquals(-1, post.getVoteCount());
    assertEquals(0, post.getUpvotes());
    assertEquals(1, post.getDownvotes());
}
```
