# Comparison: Stack Overflow vs Vending Machine

## Overview

Both systems demonstrate professional Low-Level Design (LLD) practices, but with different primary design patterns and use cases.

---

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | Stack Overflow System | Vending Machine System |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Primary Pattern** | Template Method Pattern | **State Pattern** ⭐ |
| **Use Case** | Q&A platform, content management | Product dispensing, transactions |
| **Core Abstraction** | `Post` (abstract class) | `State` (interface) |
| **Key Hierarchy** | Question/Answer extend Post | IdleState/SelectingState/etc implement State |
| **State Management** | Question status enum | Full State Pattern with objects |
| **Behavior Changes** | Via inheritance & overriding | Via state transitions |

---

## Design Pattern Usage

### Stack Overflow

```java
// Template Method Pattern (Primary)
public abstract class Post implements Votable, Commentable {
    // Template methods - common logic
    public Vote addVote(Vote vote) { /* shared logic */ }
    public void addComment(Comment comment) { /* shared logic */ }
}

public class Question extends Post { /* question-specific */ }
public class Answer extends Post { /* answer-specific */ }
```

**Purpose:** Code reuse through inheritance

### Vending Machine

```java
// State Pattern (Primary)
public interface State {
    void selectProduct(Product product);
    void insertCoin(double amount);
    // ... other operations
}

public class IdleState implements State {
    public void selectProduct(Product product) {
        // Idle-specific behavior
        context.setState(new SelectingState(context)); // Transition
    }
}
```

**Purpose:** State-dependent behavior management

---

## Common Design Patterns

Both systems use:

| Pattern | Stack Overflow Implementation | Vending Machine Implementation |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Singleton** | `StackOverflowSystem.getInstance()` | `VendingMachineSystem.getInstance()` |
| **Strategy** | `ReputationStrategy`, `SearchStrategy` | `PaymentStrategy` |
| **Observer** | `NotificationObserver` (answers, votes) | `VendingMachineObserver` (dispensing, stock) |

---

## Architecture Comparison

### Stack Overflow Architecture

```
StackOverflowSystem (Singleton)
         ↓
    Post (Abstract)
    /           \
Question      Answer
    ↓            ↓
  Vote        Comment
    ↓
ReputationStrategy (Strategy)
SearchStrategy (Strategy)
NotificationObserver (Observer)
```

**Focus:** Content hierarchy and relationships

### Vending Machine Architecture

```
VendingMachineSystem (Singleton)
         ↓
VendingMachineContext
         ↓
    State (Interface)
    /    |    |    \
Idle Selecting Payment Dispensing
         ↓
PaymentStrategy (Strategy)
VendingMachineObserver (Observer)
```

**Focus:** State transitions and behavior

---

## When Behavior Changes

### Stack Overflow: Via Inheritance

```java
// Question has specific behavior
public class Question extends Post {
    public void accept(Answer answer) {
        this.acceptedAnswer = answer;  // Question-specific
    }
}

// Answer has different behavior  
public class Answer extends Post {
    public void markAsAccepted() {
        this.isAccepted = true;  // Answer-specific
    }
}
```

**Change Type:** Different types of objects (Question vs Answer)

### Vending Machine: Via State

```java
// Same object, different behavior based on state

// In IdleState
public void insertCoin(double amount) {
    System.out.println("Select product first");
}

// In SelectingState  
public void insertCoin(double amount) {
    totalPaid += amount;
    if (totalPaid >= price) {
        context.setState(new PaymentState(context));
    }
}
```

**Change Type:** Same object in different states

---

## SOLID Principles Application

Both systems fully implement all 5 SOLID principles:

### Single Responsibility Principle

**Stack Overflow:**
- `User` - user management
- `Question` - question data
- `Answer` - answer data
- `Vote` - voting
- `StackOverflowSystem` - orchestration

**Vending Machine:**
- `IdleState` - idle behavior
- `SelectingState` - selection behavior
- `Product` - product data
- `Inventory` - stock management
- `VendingMachineSystem` - orchestration

### Open/Closed Principle

**Stack Overflow:**
```java
// Add new reputation strategy without modifying existing code
public class StrictReputationStrategy implements ReputationStrategy {
    // New algorithm
}
```

**Vending Machine:**
```java
// Add new state without modifying existing states
public class MaintenanceState implements State {
    // New state behavior
}
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle

**Stack Overflow:**
```java
ReputationStrategy strategy = new DefaultReputationStrategy();
strategy = new GenerousReputationStrategy();  // Substitutable
```

**Vending Machine:**
```java
State state = new IdleState(context);
state = new SelectingState(context);  // Substitutable
```

### Interface Segregation Principle

**Stack Overflow:**
```java
interface Votable { /* only voting */ }
interface Commentable { /* only commenting */ }
interface SearchStrategy { /* only searching */ }
```

**Vending Machine:**
```java
interface State { /* only state operations */ }
interface PaymentStrategy { /* only payment */ }
interface VendingMachineObserver { /* only notifications */ }
```

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Both depend on abstractions, not concretions:

**Stack Overflow:** Depends on `ReputationStrategy` interface  
**Vending Machine:** Depends on `State` interface

---

## Thread Safety

Both systems use identical thread-safety approaches:

| Feature | Stack Overflow | Vending Machine |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Singleton** | Double-checked locking | Double-checked locking |
| **Collections** | `ConcurrentHashMap` | `ConcurrentHashMap` |
| **Counters** | `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong` | `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong` |
| **Lists** | `CopyOnWriteArrayList` | `CopyOnWriteArrayList` |
| **Synchronization** | Synchronized methods | Synchronized methods |

---

## Code Complexity

### Stack Overflow
- **Primary Complexity:** Managing relationships (questions, answers, comments, votes)
- **Lines of Code:** ~2,000 lines
- **Number of Classes:** ~25 classes
- **Key Challenge:** Content hierarchy and voting system

### Vending Machine
- **Primary Complexity:** Managing state transitions
- **Lines of Code:** ~1,500 lines
- **Number of Classes:** ~20 classes
- **Key Challenge:** State-dependent behavior

---

## Use Case Scenarios

### Stack Overflow Scenarios

1. User posts question
2. Another user answers
3. Answer gets upvoted
4. Question author accepts answer
5. Users comment on posts
6. Search for questions by tags/keywords

**Flow:** Linear content creation and interaction

### Vending Machine Scenarios

1. Customer selects product (Idle → Selecting)
2. Customer inserts coins (Selecting → Payment)
3. Machine dispenses (Payment → Dispensing)
4. Return to idle (Dispensing → Idle)
5. Customer cancels (Selecting → Idle)

**Flow:** Circular state transitions

## When to Use Each Pattern

### Use Template Method (like Stack Overflow) When:

✅ Multiple classes share common behavior  
✅ Need to avoid code duplication  
✅ Subclasses provide specific implementations  
✅ Hierarchy makes sense (is-a relationship)  
✅ Behavior varies by class type

**Example Use Cases:**
- Document types (Report, Invoice, Letter)
- Game characters (Warrior, Mage, Archer)
- Vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck)

### Use State Pattern (like Vending Machine) When:

✅ Object behavior changes based on state  
✅ Multiple states with different behaviors  
✅ Complex conditional logic  
✅ State transitions are well-defined  
✅ Same object, different behaviors

**Example Use Cases:**
- Order processing (Pending, Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered)
- Connection states (Connecting, Connected, Disconnected)
- Media player (Playing, Paused, Stopped)
- TCP connections (Listen, Established, Closed)

---

## Code Style Similarities

Both projects share:

1. ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - README, design highlights, explanations
2. ✅ **Clean code** - Well-named classes and methods
3. ✅ **Professional structure** - Organized package hierarchy
4. ✅ **Demo classes** - Full scenario demonstrations
5. ✅ **UML diagrams** - Visual documentation
